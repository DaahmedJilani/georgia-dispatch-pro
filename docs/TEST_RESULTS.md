## ⚠️ Known Limitations & Configuration Needed

### 1. Database Trigger HTTP Configuration
**Status:** ⚠️ REQUIRES MANUAL CONFIGURATION

**Issue:** Triggers use `net.http_post()` which requires Supabase app settings:
- `app.settings.supabase_url`
- `app.settings.service_role_key`

**Impact:**
- SMS notifications on load assignment won't fire automatically
- Invoice auto-generation on delivery won't fire automatically

**Workaround:**
- Manual SMS testing via edge function directly
- Manual invoice creation via UI

**Solution Options:**
1. Configure app settings in Supabase (requires advanced access)
2. Refactor triggers to use Supabase client instead of HTTP calls
3. Use manual processes until triggers configured

### 2. Airwallex Integration
**Status:** ⚠️ REQUIRES COMPANY CREDENTIALS

**Steps to Configure:**
1. Company admin logs in
2. Navigate to Settings → Airwallex
3. Enter Airwallex API Key
4. Enter Airwallex Account ID
5. Save credentials

**Test with:** Airwallex sandbox/demo credentials

### 3. Twilio SMS Configuration
**Status:** ✅ CREDENTIALS CONFIGURED

**Secrets Set:**
- `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` ✅
- `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN` ✅
- `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER` ✅

**Note:** Edge function ready but trigger needs HTTP configuration

### 4. OpenAI Integration (Document Extraction)
**Status:** ✅ API KEY CONFIGURED

**Secrets Set:**
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` ✅

**Ready for:** Document parsing and data extraction
