### 12. ✅ Tenant Privacy
**Status: VERIFIED - FULLY ISOLATED**

**Multi-Tenant Test Results:**

  - Invoices: 3

✓ All data properly scoped to company_id
✓ RLS policies enforce company isolation
✓ No cross-company data leakage
✓ User can only access their company's data
```

**Isolation Mechanisms:**
1. **RLS Policies:** Every table filtered by `company_id = get_user_company(auth.uid())`
2. **Security Definer Functions:** `get_user_company()` prevents recursive RLS
3. **Foreign Keys:** Enforce referential integrity

---

### 14. ⚠️ Create User and Invite
**Status: REQUIRES MANUAL SETUP**

**Requested User:** Ahmad@georgiaindustrials.com

**Issue:** User accounts must be created via Supabase Auth, not direct SQL insert.

**Instructions to Complete:**
1. Go to Lovable Cloud > Authentication
2. Click "Invite User" or use magic link
3. Enter email: `Ahmad@georgiaindustrials.com`
4. User receives email invitation
5. Upon first login, profile auto-created via `handle_new_user()` trigger
6. Admin assigns driver role via UI or SQL:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO user_roles (user_id, company_id, role)
   VALUES ('{user_id}', '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001', 'driver');
   ```

**Note:** Demo driver profiles already exist in database and can be associated with new user account.

3. **Airwallex:** Requires company-specific API keys to be entered in Settings
4. **Google Maps:** Requires GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY environment variable

### 📋 Recommendations for Production
1. **Configure DocuSign API:**
   - Add DOCUSIGN_INTEGRATION_KEY secret
   - Add DOCUSIGN_ACCOUNT_ID secret
   - Update `docusign-send-contract` edge function

2. **Set Up Payment Processing:**
   - Admins enter Airwallex keys in Settings > Airwallex Integration
   - Test payment link generation
   - Configure webhook for payment confirmations

3. **Enable Monitoring:**
   - Set up Supabase logging and alerts
   - Monitor edge function errors
   - Track SMS delivery rates
   - Monitor GPS update frequency

4. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Enable PostgREST connection pooling
   - Add database query caching
   - Implement pagination for large datasets
   - Optimize real-time subscriptions

5. **User Training:**
   - Create admin user guide
   - Driver portal training materials
