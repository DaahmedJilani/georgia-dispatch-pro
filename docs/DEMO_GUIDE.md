## ⚠️ Demo Tips & Troubleshooting

### Best Practices
1. **Use Chrome** for best compatibility
2. **Test before demo** - Run through once beforehand
3. **Have backup plan** - Know manual workarounds if automation fails
4. **Keep it simple** - Focus on core workflow, not edge cases
5. **Tell stories** - Use real-world scenarios (e.g., "David just picked up electronics in Atlanta...")

### Common Issues

- **Cause:** Company credentials not configured
- **Workaround:** Show UI, explain: "Once you add your Airwallex credentials in Settings, this generates a payment link instantly."
